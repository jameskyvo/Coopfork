# selection (Single-player / Host / Join) is handled by the in-game
# CO-OP main menu, not a pre-launch dialog. CFBundleExecutable still
# points to "Cataclysm.sh" so we keep the filename; the build pipeline
# overwrites that file with this content.

# Resolve cc-sounds.zip from the GitHub releases API instead of the
# /releases/latest/download/<name> redirect: that redirect only resolves the
# newest NON-prerelease release, but every cddacoop build ships as a
# prerelease, so it 404s. The API lists releases newest-first INCLUDING
# prereleases — we take the first one whose assets include cc-sounds.zip, so
# the pack resolves even if the very newest build didn't re-upload it.

# CO.AG-music-only, or any pack dropped in manually, so we never re-prompt
# someone who already has sound just because their folder isn't named
# exactly "CC-Sounds".
#
# EXCLUDE the bundled placeholder packs: CC-Sounds proper is stripped from the
# zip to keep the download small, but the build still ships Menu_Sound_Test (tiny
# menu-click sounds) so SOUND=1 has something. Its soundpack.txt would otherwise
# satisfy this check and suppress the CC-Sounds prompt for EVERYONE — shipping the
# game with no real in-game audio and no nudge to fix it. Only a real pack
# (incl. CC-Sounds-sfx-only) counts.
